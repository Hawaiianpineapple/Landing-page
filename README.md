This is my first full page from scratch.
The objective is to incorporate everything I've been learning from TOP.

including html, css, flexbox. Most of these will be rough and basic.

All copyright photos will credited with Author's name and how to find them at the bottom of 
README.md 

At the end of this project it will be published on TOP as well as on my git account.

Since I have a full-time job at the moment and taking this at a slow pace, i'm including a more detailed commit log here sorta like my own daily journal that will consist of my thoughts on progress and self-reflection and thing I might want to update if I ever come back to the project after learning more.

Update method. using a traditional journal system like day 1...day 2 etc. seems weird to me and I want it feel more like the commit messages but in a more relaxed tone and to give context to my choices. This way it feels more personal and will keep me motivated. More than likely its not an industry standard since its used for product update sets that are usable. so I'll be using snapshots like Minecraft first placement will be the product number, the second is major changes and the last is minor changes. 

snapshot 1.0.0 - setting up the repos path and important files i.e. (index, css).

snapshot 1.0.1 - the addition of images directory along with repective content. Images and authors are at the bottom of the README. NOTES-- I figure I should decide on a theme wether or not I follow it to the end is debatable but I've decided on tech and although the template that was given for the project isn't quite the fit I for it, it gives it some personality. 

snapshot 1.1.1 - first major update adding html basic structure to header including filler text and images including logo. NOTES-- Although it doesn't seem like much,(the filler text and html structure) the hardest part was the logo. Thinking it would be simple using a svg I've learned that not all browsers load them correctly and my understanding isn't advanced enough to fix them. Everything I've read so far says to try xlink or embed both of which complicate things beyond what I'm capable of at the moment. Unfortunely that means I have to use a png. It works but I wanted something that could scale easily.

snapsht 1.2.1 - completed all the major html filler content with images minus id's and class tags or polishing to html tree. Header text, size and color have been set to assignment reqirements. NOTES-- honestly not much to say, pretty much just looking at what the assignment wants and adding it in didn't really run into much of a problem with anything. Mostly likely flexbox stuff will be hard and ill have to ajust the html and containers.
