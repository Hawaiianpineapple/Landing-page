This is my first full page from scratch.
The objective is to incorporate everything I've been learning from TOP.

including html, css, flexbox. Most of these will be rough and basic.

All copyright photos will credited with Author's name and how to find them at the bottom of 
README.md 

At the end of this project it will be published on TOP as well as on my git account.

Since I have a full-time job at the moment and taking this at a slow pace, i'm including a more detailed commit log here sorta like my own daily journal that will consist of my thoughts on progress and self-reflection and thing I might want to update if I ever come back to the project after learning more.
